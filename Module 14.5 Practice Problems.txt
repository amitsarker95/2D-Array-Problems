ARRAY-RELATED PRACTICE DAY
1. WAP that will take (n x n) integer inputs into a square matrix of dimension n (where n must be an odd number). Then calculate the sum of the integers based on the following position pattern (consider only the boxed position during the sum). Please see the input-output.

2. WAP that will take inputs of a n sized square matrix into a 2D array. Now show all the elements of its two diagonals. Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal

	Major diagonal: 1 4 2 9 4
Minor diagonal: 5 2 2 7 1
	

3.        WAP that will take the size of an identity matrix from the user and generate the identity matrix into a 2D array. Finally display it. Reference:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix

4. WAP that will take (m x n) integer inputs into a matrix of dimension m x n. Now reverse that matrix within itself and display it. The reversal means swapping the 1st column with the nth column, the 2nd column with the (n-1)th column, and so on…

5. WAP that will take (m x n) positive integer inputs into a matrix of dimension m x n. Now replace all the duplicate integers by -1 in that matrix. Finally display it.
